Unlike other AI-driven automation tools, Mitsui Terminal is a self-hosted and non-custodial platform, meaning users maintain full control over their assets at all times. Mitsui Terminal does not store private keys or require third-party trust, which ensures maximum security and privacy. Users can deploy and manage their own instance of the terminal, giving them the flexibility to customize workflows, integrate new protocols, leverage mini apps, and retain full sovereignty over their DeFi interactions.
With Mitsui Terminal, users can engage in a variety of workflows:
- **Trading Automation**: Set up AI-driven driven strategies that execute trades based on real-time market conditions through its If-This-Then-That (IFTTT) mini app. 
- **Lending Optimization**: Allocate assets across multiple lending markets while minimizing risk.
- **Airdrop Management**: Track, qualify for, and automatically claim upcoming airdrops such Walrus.
- **Risk Assessment & Alerts**: Receive predictive insights and alerts on potential market downturns or opportunities based on open data sets, and real-time data (e.g. Twitter feed, RSS)
- **DeFi Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor and rebalance assets across multiple protocols with real-time updates.
